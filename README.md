# WAGNER_RNAseq_Study

This project involves the analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data and is structured into two independent studies:

Treatment-Based Study: Examines the effects of anti-TNF alpha and TCZ treatments before and after exercise.

Condition-Based Study: Compares gene expression across three conditions-sedentary, breaks, and exercise-for each participant.

Both studies aim to uncover molecular changes associated with exercise, treatment response, and activity patterns
